#           Ubuntu 24.04 Server Initial Setup & Hardening Script
#
#  This script performs the following actions:
#  1. Sets up the shell for verbose and safe execution.
#  2. Updates and upgrades all system packages non-interactively.
#  3. Installs and configures UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow SSH.
#  4. Installs and hardens SSH access using Fail2ban to prevent brute-force attacks.
#  5. Installs Docker Engine and Docker Compose for containerization.
#  6. Installs the lightweight XFCE Desktop Environment.
#  7. Installs the X2Go Server for efficient remote desktop access.
#
#  Designed for a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 installation.
#
#  Usage:
#  - Make the script executable: chmod +x setup_server.sh
#  - Run with sudo:           sudo ./setup_server.sh

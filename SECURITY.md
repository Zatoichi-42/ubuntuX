## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Ubuntu Server Setup seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep your system updated**: Regularly update your Ubuntu system and the setup script
2. **Use strong SSH keys**: Generate strong SSH keys (Ed25519 recommended)
3. **Change default passwords**: Always change default passwords after setup
4. **Monitor logs**: Regularly check system logs for suspicious activity
5. **Use firewall**: Keep UFW firewall enabled and properly configured
6. **Limit access**: Only open necessary ports and services
7. **Backup keys**: Securely backup your SSH keys
8. **Use VPN**: Consider using a VPN for additional security

### For Contributors

1. **Follow secure coding practices**: Validate all inputs, use parameterized queries
2. **Review code changes**: All code changes should be reviewed for security issues
3. **Test thoroughly**: Test changes in a secure environment before deployment
4. **Document security features**: Document any security-related features or changes
5. **Report vulnerabilities**: Report any security issues you discover

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **SSH Hardening**: Disables root login, password authentication, configures key-based auth
- **fail2ban**: Protects against brute force attacks
- **UFW Firewall**: Configures firewall with proper port rules
- **Security Banner**: Adds warning banner for SSH connections
- **Input Validation**: Validates all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Prevents information disclosure through errors

### Security Configuration

The setup script implements several security best practices:

1. **SSH Configuration**:
   - Disables root login
   - Enables key-based authentication only
   - Disables password authentication
   - Sets security timeouts and limits
   - Configures security banner

2. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Denies incoming connections by default
   - Allows only necessary ports
   - Enables logging

3. **System Hardening**:
   - Installs security updates
   - Configures fail2ban
   - Sets proper file permissions
   - Removes unnecessary packages

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. **Confirm the problem** and determine the affected versions
2. **Audit code** to find any similar problems
3. **Prepare fixes** for all supported versions
4. **Release new versions** with the fixes
5. **Publicly announce** the vulnerability and the fix

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked as security updates in the changelog.

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to respond to issues before any disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason
